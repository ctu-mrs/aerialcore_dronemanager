# AerialCore drone manager

* example tmux session for simulation in [here](./tmux)
* the _world frame_ name and path to the trajectory file is specified in the [launch file](./launch/drone_manager.launch)
* check the [config file](./config/drone_manager.yaml) for additional options

## TODO

**This is just a _template_, i.e., a _minimalistic implementaion_. I don't want to see this running on a real drone! Safety conditions and overall sanity checks should be implemented.**
